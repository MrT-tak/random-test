title: 'A Week In Birmingham'
---
Today, 29th of December 2024 is offically a week since I arrived at Birmingham City, England.
I've moved from Lamac, Bratislava City, Slovakia to Birmingham.
I havent moved in a while, so the whole moving was quite interesting.

I left Devin Hotel in 4 AM. Our taxi driver took us to Vienna Airport (VIE/LOWW) and we said goodbye.
Our flight was BHX via MUC from VIE.
Basically, we took a connecting flight from Vienna Airport (VIE/LOWW) to Munich Airport (MUC) then to Birmingham Airport (BHX).
The Vienna Aiport to Munich was Austrian Airlines. I've flown with them other the years, and I do not hate it nor exceptionally love it.
I am a fan of ANA although I havent got a chance to eat their foods recently, I heard the quality dropped after the Coronavirus outbreak. I hope they recover.

I took a Lufthansa City flight for Munich (MUC) to Birmingham Airport (BHX).
